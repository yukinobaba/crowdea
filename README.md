# Datasets
Datasets are available in `data/`. Table 1 is generated by `jupyter/data.ipynb`.

# Implementation
Implementation of CrowDEA, BPR, Blade-chest, CrowdBT, and BT are available in `code/`.

# Q1: Visualization
Figures 2(a) and 2(b) are plots of `result/design/olympic/crowdea_x_alpha0.1_d2.dat` and `result/design/olympic/bpr\_lambda0.001\_d2\_nonnegx.dat`. 

# Q2: Accuracy
Estimated parameters are available in the `result` directory. Table 4 is generated by `jupyter/Q2_accuracy.ipynb`. Figures 3(a) and (b) are generated by `jupyter/Q2_example.ipynb`.

# Q3: Efficienty
Sampled datasets are available in `data_e20`, `data_e50`, and `data_e100` for Figure 4(a) and `data_1000`, `data_2000`, `data_5000`, `data_10000`, and `data_20000` for Figure 4(b). The corresponding `result_*` directories contain the estimated parameters. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) generated by `jupyter/Q3_efficiency_evaluator.ipynb` and `jupyter/Q3_efficiency_label.ipynb`.
